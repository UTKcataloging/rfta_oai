      <title>Interview with Becky Jackson, 2019-11-09</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Becky Jackson, former resident of Gatlinburg. Jackson recounts the difficulty of the fire with family members all separated and trying to reunite. She also discusses the difficulties faced in losing her home and then going through a divorce. The role played by the community and family members to alleviate the loss are also described. This is a representative quote from the interview: "My first instinct wasn't my home or anything. It was more about how are people gettting out of there that don't know the roads like we do, that are there on vacation? </abstract>
