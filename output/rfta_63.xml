      <title>Interview with Russell Biven, 2020-02-21</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Russell Biven of WBIR news station in Knoxville. Biven recounts being a reporter on the front line during the wildfires' aftermath. He discusses the stories that left a lasting impression on him personally during that time. He also talks on the difficulties in covering a disaster when it is so close to home. This is a representative quote from the interview: "We want to get it right, we want to tell the facts, and we want to do it the right way and be objective about it, but when the shift is over, you're still a human being."</abstract>
