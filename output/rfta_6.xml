      <title>Interview with Zachary James, 2019-09-20</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Zachary James, student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville from Sevierville, Tennessee. James discusses his experience as a high school student in Sevierville during the time of the wildfires, including memories of classmates who were impacted, the closing of Sevier County schools, and the relief efforts. This is a representative quote from the interview: "Most of the people who lived in Gatlinburg were like, 'You should come down, see what happened, visit some of the areas that were affected.' Because a lot of these businesses depend on tourists."
