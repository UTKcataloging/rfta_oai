      <title>Interview with Brandon Matheny, 2019-11-07</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Brandon Matheny, professor with the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department of UT. Matheny discusses the effects of the fire upon fungi of the reason, particularly how it allows certain species to fruit and spread. He also touches upon the effects that climate change is having upon the region. This is a representative quote from the interview: "I was seeing some of the same fungi in this burn here in the Southeast as I had seen out west and read about being reported in Europe."</abstract>
