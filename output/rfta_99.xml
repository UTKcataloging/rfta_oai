      <title>Interview with Kathy Waltosz, 2020-06-11</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Kathy Waltosz, a volunteer with Samaritan's Purse,conducted by Laura Romans. Waltosz provides an overview of Samaritan's Purse and discusses the efforts in helping survivors to sift through ashes of burned homes for valuables. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "I've seen a range of heat damage in different fires, and of course when a house burns and it doesn't have any water coming on it, it'll just go up in flames and then it'll get quite hot, to the point where it will consume everything in the house. If there's no water that comes on it when the fire is burned out in a house, you can have a one story house and what's left is about two to three inches of debris."</abstract>
