      <title>Interview with Anne May, 2020-01-11</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Anne May of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. May provides a background for the school before discussing the events of the fire. She recounts helping the artists in residence to evacuate from the campus before evacuating from the town herself. She then tells about the community involvement Arrowmont had in Gatlinburg during the recovery period. This is a representative quote from the interview: "There were people out there that their interest was knowing that in order for Gatlinburg to come back, people were gonna have to be very purposeful in how they contributed to that effort."</abstract>
