      <title>Interview with Gary Ownby, 2020-02-22</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Gary Ownby, a teacher at Pi Beta Phi Elementary in Gatlinburg. Ownby talks about the community history of Gatlinburg before recounting his personal events during the fire. He discusses the challenges faced with relocating to the old George Pittman Elementary School, and how his faith and church provided the opportunity to serve the community following the disaster. This is a representative quote from the interview: Just up above them, there's a tree across the road suspended on power lines. Jill's car can't get through, it's first. Then my car is a little Subaru, it was lower than her's. I've got that Boy Scout knife. We started breaking limbs. Now Jill's down below cutting things with the scout knife. And Jill said every time we broke a limb or cut something, just increments, the trees started raising because it's lighter on that power line.</abstract>
