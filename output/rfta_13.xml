   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Frances Shambaugh, lifelong resident of Gatlinburg. Shambaugh recounts her evacuation and time spent afterwards at the community center. She discusses the efforts in the community to support one another and her own efforts at rebuilding her home and studio.

A strong sense of not only us helping each other, but people all over the country helping us."
