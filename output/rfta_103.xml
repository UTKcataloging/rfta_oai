      <title>Interview with Tommy Smith, 2020-06-19</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Tommy Smith, volunteer with Samaritan's Purse, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Smith details his personal experiences volunteering with the organization in Gatlinburg and the families that he encountered. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "You get to his driveway, and it's these big, gray boulders, you have to go around the curb to see a beautiful log cabin made out of chestnut logs. He's bracing himself and he turns the corner and it's nothing but a slab and smoldering ashes."</abstract>
