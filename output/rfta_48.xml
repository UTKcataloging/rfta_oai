      <title>Interview with Dianne Britton, 2020-01-10</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Dianne Britton, volunteer with the Red Cross. Britton discusses her role with the Red Cross in connecting survivors with mental health resources. She also recounts some of the general feelings and mood found in the shelters, and compares this disaster to others that she has experienced. This is a representative quote from the interview: "You can't make this kind of thing better. There's nothing you can do to fix it or make it better. To me, the only thing you can do, is not make it worse."</abstract>
