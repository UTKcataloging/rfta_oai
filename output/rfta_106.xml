      <title>Interview with Lukas Ray, 2020-08-04</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Lukas Ray, formerly with Appalachian Service Project, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Ray discusses the process through which families and individuals were identified for the home rebuilding process. He  Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "I think getting into cleaning up the properties after we were there would be some of the hardest things you do, because we would come across things that we would put off to the side that were burnt, obviously burnt, but could be a family treasurer or something they wanted. They won't. It's amazing what things do survive fires when you're digging through rubbles."</abstract>
