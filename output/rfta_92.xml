      <title>Interview with Charlie Anderson, 2020-05-15</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Charlie Anderson, owner of Tree Tops Resort in Gatlinburg, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Anderson discusses being in the hospitality business in Gatlinburg, and the effects of the wildfires on the resort. He also talks about the efforts to search for possible victims and the troubles faced during reconstruction. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "Finally, we were able to get back on the property on Friday, and when we first arrived at the property, it's very difficult to tell you my emotions, my thoughts, and everything because this was my baby. I had birthed it, and to see the destruction was probably one of the worst war scenes I've probably have ever seen."</abstract>
