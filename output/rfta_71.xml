      <title>Interview with Sarah Praskievicz, 2020-03-13</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Sarah Praskievicz, professor with the Department of Geography, Environment, and Sustainability at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Praskievicz discusses her research on the effects of the fire on the water systems of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Conducted over Zoom. This is a representative quote from the interview: One thing we thought we might see was a relationship between the percentage of the drainage area of each site that was within the burned area. And we did not see that pattern. There was no apparent relationship. Instead, it seemed to be much more affected by the burn severity immediately adjacent to the channels.</abstract>
