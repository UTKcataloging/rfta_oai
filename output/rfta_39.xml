      <title>Interview with Leslie Wereszczak, 2019-12-13</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Leslie Wereszczak, small animal ICU supervisor for the UT College of Veterinary Medicine. Wereszczak discusses the treatment of victims from the fire, particularly cats. This includes the management of their pain as well as dressing burns mostly located on their footpads and faces.
 This is a representative quote from the interview: "It was something that we never saw coming, and I don't know how we made it through that month. I really don't, but we did. It definitely changed me, for the good."</abstract>
