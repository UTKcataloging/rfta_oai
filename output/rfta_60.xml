      <title>Interview with Larry Waters, 2020-02-20</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Larry Waters, Sevier County Mayor. Waters provides a brief background about Sevier County and Gatlinburg before discussing the events of the fire. He addresses the needs of a public official during a crisis and how he balanced that with personal concerns for his family. Waters also recounts the efforts following the fire to rebuild the city and bring back the tourism industry. This is a representative quote from the interview: "Love this area, love the mountains, love its people. When you finally realized what kind of devastation this firestorm had caused, it was a very emotional experience because you hate to see an area you love and people you love that are suffer as people did in that disaster. So it was a very unsettling and upsetting and emotional time."</abstract>
