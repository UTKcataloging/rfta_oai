      <title>Interview with Marshall Ramsey, 2022-01-14</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Marshall Ramsey, editor-at-large for the Mississippi Today and nationally recognized editorial cartoonist, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Ramsey discusses his ties to the Smoky Mountains and the impact the wildfire had on his family and friends. He explains how the wildfire has emotionally influenced some of his cartoons. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "To look back on the Gatlinburg fire five years ago and to see how that city, the Pigeon Forge area, and some of the areas in Wears Valley and Cobbly Nob, to see how the recovery has happened and to see why it happened the way it did. Because people love the Smokies, because people loved each other, and because people cared about each other."</abstract>
