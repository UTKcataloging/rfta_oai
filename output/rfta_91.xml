      <title>Interview with Gary Wilson, 2020-05-14</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Gary Wilson, former videographer for the Great Smoky Mountain Association. Wilson recounts his experiences leading up to and during the fire collecting footage of the disaster. He also discusses his views on the role that Park Services had in causing the fire. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: It was somewhere around the 2nd week of November, and there was a point where there were about 5 different fires up on top of Clingmans Dome, you could see 5 different fires on the landscape out there.</abstract>
