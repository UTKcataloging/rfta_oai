This is a representative quote from the interview: She sent me a video, how the fires are around that hotel. Which, the hotel is in town, you know, it's five minutes from my house. I can see it from here, I'm actually looking at it from my house. And then I showed that to my friends like, "hey, guys, watch this." I feel that time for me, everything was a joke. I didn't think it was gonna, you know, be like that until I saw the damage a few days after, when I started crying actually, and realized that everything was so serious.</abstract>
