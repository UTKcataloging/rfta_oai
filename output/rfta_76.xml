      <title>Interview with Bob Sweeney, 2020-03-14</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Bob Sweeney, resident of Gatlinburg. Sweeney describes the fire as a someone who recently moved to the area before suffering losses. He recounts the following days and months in terms of the lessons he learned from the wildfire and the opportunities that it provided. This is a representative quote from the interview: We look over and there's a a flower pot with some pansies still planted in it that was untouched. And there were a few items like that just scattered around, a bench over here that didn't burn. And I think we went over and we kind of talked about how funny that was. And we were just kind of skirting around the fact that there wasn't any house there, and all of that I guess. You just kind of push yourself over into a safer place for a minute.</abstract>
