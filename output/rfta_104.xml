      <title>Interview with Emily Schubert, 2020-07-09</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Emily Schubert, former artist in residence at Arrowmont, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Schubert discusses her role at Arrowmont before recounting the events of the wildfires. She also details how the event has affected her and her art over the long term. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "I also remember passing like a bunch of just demolished cars. There were a bunch of wrecks because people were rushing so fast. And I remember passing this one like silver sports vehicle and thinking there is no way that the person that was in that car is not hurt because it was just completely--I've never seen a car look at that after a wreck. And you can tell that all the airbags went off, and it caught fire and it was horrible, and it was just like pushed to the side of the road."</abstract>
