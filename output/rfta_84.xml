      <title>Interview with Stacia Martin-West, 2020-04-23</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Stacia Martin-West, professor with the College of Social Work at the University of Tennessee. Martin-West discusses her research focused on unconditional cash transfers provided to survivors of the wildfires. She also discusses the perceptions surrounding these transfers. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: What we saw though, after the one year mark, is that most of the individuals that had been homeowners previously were able to purchase new residences--residence or they were able to rebuild, or those that had previously been in apartments were able to start renting again. And so, I think just looking at that in itself is a success, right.</abstract>
