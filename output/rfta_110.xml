      <title>Interview with Harold and Barbara Lunsford, 2020-08-14</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Harold and Barbara Lunsford, volunteers with Samaritan's Purse, conducted by Casey Kaufman. The Lunsford discuss their efforts in helping sift through the remains of homes for any surviving objects and the faith based services that the group offers. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "We just even with the people that had burned their homes, we saw love, and even Samaritan's Purse, those people that went out everyday, tirelessly sifting that stuff, they just showed love to us, and to the homeowners. It was just a wonderful experience."</abstract>
