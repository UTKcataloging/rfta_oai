      <title>Interview with Danny Wilson, 2022-01-13</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Danny Wilson, local artist who grew up in East Tennessee, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Wilson dicusses his experiences in Gatlinburg and what impact it had on his art career growing up. He explains how the wildfires have influenced some of his recent artwork. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "As a person who wanted to grow up and make a living doing that, it was pretty captivating to me to watch the different ways people were making money with their art. So, I think to me that was the one thing that stood out about Gatlinburg that was different."</abstract>
