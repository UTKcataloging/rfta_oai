      <title>Interview with Michelle Childs, 2019-11-09</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Michelle Childs, professor with the Retail, Hospitality, and Tourism Management department of UT. Childs discusses the effects of the wildfire on the businesses in Gatlinburg primarily over an extended time frame. She talks about the preparedness of businesses with contacting employees during the fire and in terms of insurance coverage. She also elaborates on the initial return of tourists to the area, and the steady recovery of the area. This is a representative quote from the interview: "What was really interesting because likely its such a small, tightknit community that those personal stories were really intertwined with the business stories."</abstract>
