      <title>Interview with Terry Williams, 2019-12-14</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Terry Williams, former resident of Gatlinburg, Williams discusses the day of the fire and the surprise of how close it had approached his home. He recounts his evacuation and then his return, finding that his home had been destroyed. He also talks about the community and the sense of outreach that was constant throughout the aftermath. This is a representative quote from the interview: "[The wind] was just more violent. My fear at that point had nothing to do with fire, I thought trees were gonna come crashing down onto my home. It was that much more intense then I had ever heard before."</abstract>
