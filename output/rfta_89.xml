      <title>Interview with Kathryn Ellis, 2020-05-14</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Kathryn Ellis, a lawyer with Legal Aid of East Tennessee. Ellis recounts the assistance that her organization was able to provide to individuals after the wildfires. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: "A big thing that we have to deal with after a disaster is how do you go about getting all of these important documents that you need. And so we would talk to them about their individual situation. We would talk to them about, was it a private landlord or was it subsidized housing, some sort of government funding? Because again, law's different. So, we would go through all of those sorts of questions and help give them the direction of--of what they needed to do or what their options were."</abstract>
