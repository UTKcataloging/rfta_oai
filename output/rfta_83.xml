   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Sarina Manifold, Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Manifold discusses her role at the UT Veterinary Clinic offering grief support to staff and families before the fire and how her role continued during the disaster. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: And so we need to be able to provide support to them. The people who were providing the actual medical care for the animals, they are going to be seeing things that, while they are maybe more accustomed to seeing animals in bad shape and in trauma, they're still going to have a trauma response. And so being able to identify OK, what are the areas of our expertise that we can offer support</abstract>
