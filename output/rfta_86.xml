      <title>Interview with Adesola Odunayo, 2020-04-23</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Adesola Odunayo, clinical associate professor with the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine. Odunayo discusses the challenges of treating animals that were harmed during the wildfires. She also recounts seeing families reunited with their pets and the emotional impact of the experience. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: The local thing we did was using hyperbaric oxygen, which is a treatment where an animal is put into an oxygen chamber usually for an hour. And the whole goal of that is to try to just increase oxygen delivery to the wound and in theory that should kind of help accelerate healing of the wound in the tissues in the areas.</abstract>
