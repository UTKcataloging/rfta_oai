      <title>Interview with Shirley Price, 2020-02-22</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Shirley Price, resident of Gatlinburg. Price discusses her experiences during the wildfire while hearing reports about her neighborhood burning when she was out of town. She also recounts returning to Gatlinburg to find that she had not lost her home. This is a representative quote from the interview: And when he got up on top, that's when we found out about the burn marks on the top. And that's when I was so thankful that it had two sets of shingles on that roof, because it burned through the first set or melted, and there were these holes that were right down to the plywood but didn't catch, it didn't catch the plywood on fire.</abstract>
